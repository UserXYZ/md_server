Introduction
============

Minimal metadata server to use cloud images with a standalone kvm/libvirt
server

- sets the password for default user
- sets the ssh key

Use the config file to set the password and SSH public key

Setup
=====
Add the EC2 IP to the virtbr0 bridge

# ip addr add 169.254.169.254 dev virbr0

Then start the metadata server as follows

# systemctl start mdserver

Note: Logs go to syslog for now, will fix this later
